           <p>History Gondar City, its Castles and Churches
            At an elevation of 2133 masl, Gondar or Gonder is
            located at 725 km from Addis Ababa, 175 km from
            Bahir Dar and 120km from the Simien Mountains.
            Until the seventeenth century, Ethiopia had no capital,
            as the empire's rules moved about their territory living 
            in tents in mobile royal camps while food being supplied by
            farmers around the camp. The history of Gondar as the capital of Ethiopia
            really begins In 1636, when Emperor Fasilides ended the tradition by decreeing
            Gondar to be the Ethiopia's  capital and started building a walled enclosure
            around his castle became the palace compound for half a dozen of different palaces 3 churches
            and support buildings built of two centuries by his successors. .

             Tewodros II (Ge'ez: ዳግማዊ ቴዎድሮስ, baptized as Gebre Kidan; 
             c. 1818 – 13 April 1868) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1855 until his death in 1868. 
             His rule is often placed as the beginning of
             modern Ethiopia and brought an end to the decentralized 
             Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes).Tewodros II's origins were in the Era of the Princes, but his ambitions were not those of
             the regional nobility. He sought to re-establish a cohesive Ethiopian state and to reform its
            administration and church. He sought to restore Solomonic hegemony, and he considered himself the Elect of God.[citation needed]
